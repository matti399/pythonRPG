# Basic Python RPG

https://github.com/matti399/pythonRPG

This Python program is made for educational purposes.
It is a very basic text bases RPG with some elements of the Rouge-Like genre.
Dungeon are randomly generated and so are the enemies and items along the way.

You can run it from code using at least Python 3.10 or download the executable from the releases Page.

If you have feedback oder critic for my code feel free to open an Issue.
